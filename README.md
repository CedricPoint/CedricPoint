## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m **Cédric Frank**, 28 years old.  
I work in the **construction waterproofing industry**, a demanding technical field where precision, reliability and execution matter.

Alongside my professional activity, I design and build digital solutions.

My approach is simple:
> Build systems that are clean, stable, secure and useful.

I apply the same rigor from field operations to software architecture and infrastructure management.
